# Implementation of the Go With Tests Book

Link to the book:- https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests

In this repository, I go through all the chapters from this book while trying to implement the underlying concepts in my own IDE. The main purpose if for me to get better at backend development with Go and document my perspective on different chapters along with additional things that might be helpful to setup a good foundation.
